# OrbitFolio (MVP scaffold)

This repo contains a minimal scaffold for OrbitFolio: Next.js frontend, a small Node datafeed, and Supabase schema + demo seed.

Preview steps (non-technical):
1. Create Supabase project and run infra/supabase-schema.sql and infra/demo-seed.sql.
2. Deploy `services/datafeed` to Railway and set env vars.
3. Deploy `apps/web` to Netlify and set env vars.
4. Open the Netlify preview URL and sign in with the demo account.

See the deploy guide in the project root for full step-by-step instructions.
